                    Hi there! My name is Amir and I am a mid-level JavaScript developer with a focus on UNOCSS and Vue.js.
                    
                    I have built this website using the Nuxt framework. Additionally, I am familiar with React and have used
                    it in personal projects. I also have experience with Express.js and can build my own APIs as needed. I
                    have been consistently working in front-end development for about 5 years now and am familiar with
                    TypeScript. In the past 3 years, I have specialized in Vue.js and have worked in mixed companies. I am
                    interested in taking risks and challenges and am happy to work in a team environment. I am passionate
                    about programming and always looking for new opportunities to learn.
                </p>

             
            </div>
            <p class="text-secondary font-normal text-base leading-[26.88px] mb-6">
                    Based on my experience with front-end development, Vue.js and React frameworks, as well as my ability to
                    build my own APIs with Express.js, I can contribute to the development of websites and web applications.
                    I am also interested in teamwork and can collaborate effectively with team members. Additionally, I am
                    committed to ongoing learning and staying up-to-date in order to be a valuable contributor to future
                    projects. Therefore, if you require my skillset, you can trust me to help you and I will assist you to
                    the best of my abilities.
